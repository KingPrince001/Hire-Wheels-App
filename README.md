# Car Hire Website

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a car hire website. The website allows users to browse and rent cars for their transportation needs. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to make the process of renting a car as seamless as possible.

## Features

- **Car Listings**: Users can browse through a wide range of available cars. Each car listing provides detailed information about the car, including its make, model, year, price, and availability.
- **Search and Filtering**: Users can easily search for cars based on their preferences, such as location, car type, price range, and availability dates. The website provides robust filtering options to narrow down the search results.
- **User Authentication**: Users can create an account and log in to the website. Authenticated users have access to additional features like booking a car, managing bookings, and leaving reviews.
- **Booking Management**: Authenticated users can book a car for a specific duration by selecting the desired dates. They can view and manage their bookings, including canceling or modifying existing bookings.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: Users can leave ratings and reviews for the cars they have rented. This feature helps future users make informed decisions based on the experiences of previous renters.
- **Admin Panel**: An admin panel is available to manage the car listings, user accounts, and bookings. Admins have the ability to add new cars, update existing listings, and handle user-related tasks.
- **Payment Integration**: The website integrates with a payment gateway to facilitate secure online payments for car rentals. Users can enter their payment details and complete the booking process smoothly.
